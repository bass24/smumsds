# Unit 5 Homework
The purpose of this project is to take two data sets and combine then into one. The first data set is the most popular names in 2016 (yob2016.txt) and the other data set is the most popular names in 2015 (yob2015.txt). Once the data sets are merged create a new file that gives the 10 most people girl names (TopTenGirlNames.csv).

# Files:
    yob2015: Data set of most people boys and girls names in 2015 (comma delimited)
    yob2016: Data set of most people boys and girls names in 2016 (semicolon delimited)
